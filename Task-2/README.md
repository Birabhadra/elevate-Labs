# AI & ML Internship - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships using visual and statistical tools.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Loaded Titanic dataset and checked basic statistics and null values.
2. Handled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`.
3. Plotted histograms and boxplots to understand data distribution and outliers.
4. Used heatmaps and pairplots to identify correlations and relationships.
5. Made observations from visualizations (e.g., survival rate by gender and class).

## 📈 Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Fare and Age showed varied distribution and some outliers.

## 📂 Files
- `EDA_Titanic.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with full code and visualizations.
- `titanic.csv` - Dataset used.
- Screenshots (if any).
